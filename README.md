# How to Launch:

You can launch Onion Desktop Tools using either:

## .exe Launchers (Recommended for convenience)
- **Onion Desktop Tools.exe** - Launches with hidden console (cleaner interface)
- **Onion Desktop Tools - WithConsole.exe** - Launches with visible console (useful for debugging)

## .bat Launchers (Recommended to avoid antivirus warnings)
- **_Onion Desktop Tools - Launcher.bat** - Launches with hidden console
- **_Onion Desktop Tools - Launcher (With Console).bat** - Launches with visible console

Both methods are functionally equivalent. The .bat files are more transparent and less likely to trigger antivirus software.
